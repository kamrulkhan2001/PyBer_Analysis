Overview

THe CEO has tasked us with creating a summary dataframe by city types. then creating a multi-line graph that would show total weekly fares for each city type.

Results

From our summary we can see that:

Rural areas have the highest average fare per driver but lower total rides and lower total drivers. Suburban areas have more rides and drivers but a lower average fare per ride. Finally, Urban drivers have the most total rides and drivers but the lowest Average per ride and driver

This tells us that the fewer drivers and rides in a neighborhood leads to higher fares.
